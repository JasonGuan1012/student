    "\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction**\n",
    "    - Variables are considered abstraction as they assign a value to another value. In other words, they basically describe values to each other.\n",
    "        - firstName = \"Jason\" # this is a string\n",
    "            print(firstName)\n",
    "\n",
    "            highScore = 33 # this is an integer\n",
    "            print(highScore)\n",
    "- **Algorithms**\n",
    "    - A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.\n",
    "        - For example, When you go to bake cookies you use specific steps\n",
    "    - Sequencing are things that are done in order. \n",
    "    - Selection are to do first step, make decision(yes or no), step true or false(if, or, else)\n",
    "- **Boolean If**\n",
    "    - Relational Operators are used to compare two variables, returns a boolean.\n",
    "    - Data-type that can either be true or false\n",
    "    - Logic gates combine different boolean (true/false or 1/0) values into a single boolean value. As computers are composed of a bunch of binary/boolean values, logic gates are the “logic” of the computer (the ability to code).\n",
    "- **Iterations**v\n",
    "    - We learned about While loops, range, for loop, try and except, and Continue and Break.\n",
    "    - For loops is used to literate over a sequence. \n",
    "        - For instances, a list, tuple, string, or range.\n",
    "- **Developing Algorithms**\n",
    "    - An algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It has a sequence of events, inputs, and outputs.\n",
    "    - It is important because it solves a problem in a way that it can be applied to any similar problem. It allows the computer to solve the problem on its own w/o any form of human interference.\n",
    "- **List and Search**\n",
    "    - [] = List\n",
    "    - A Python list is an ordered and changeable collection of data objects. Unlike an array, which can contain objects of a single type, a list can contain a mixture of objects. They start from 0. (The 1st element would actually be the 0th element)\n",
    "- **Developing Procedures**\n",
    "    - A procedure is a named group of programming instructions with a purpose and is called to perform a task based on the commands.\n",
    "    - We also learned about what a return value is, and also class, which is an outline for a set of nested functions.\n",
    "- **Libraries**\n",
    "    - There are different types of libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc...\n",
    "    - Te APIs explain how two separate pices of software interact w/h each other, and they also need documenttation to keep this communication gong.\n",
    "- **Simulations**\n",
    "    - A simulation is the use of a computer software to represent the dynamic responses of one system by the behaviour of another system modeled after it.\n",
    "    - We also learned about \"Random\", which is a buily-in python function that allow the user to draw a random value from a set range.\n",
    "    - A simulation uses a mathematical descriptions, or models, of a real system in the form of a computer program."

    "## CB Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are the questions that I got wrong / Quiz Corrections\n",
    "    - Q5\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C not B because the code segment will set One word, ticket Price to 17 for all purchasers between the ages of 12 and 60, regardless of whether or not the movie is 3-D.\n",
    "    - Q8\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of A because the name of the person who took a photo is not captured in the photo data.\n",
    "    - Q12\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of A because approximation 30.6 million would be a better estimate for year 11.\n",
    "    - Q14\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C instead of B because the programs display different values.\n",
    "    - Q17\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of A because A lack of access to devices contributes to the digital divide. This issue could be addressed by providing free or low-cost devices. Providing networks and infrastructure would address a lack of access to networks which also contributes to the digital divide.\n",
    "    - Q23\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of C because there are multiple paths from P to S (for example, P to S and P to Q to S).\n",
    "    - Q24\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C instead of B because while some pairs of characters of the original string are replaced in the encoded string with a single character, this transformation is not lossy because the original version can be restored.\n",
    "    - Q27\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of D because Inserting Win from true, between line 21 and line 22 will cause the loop to terminate after checking the first guess, regardless of whether the guess is correct.\n",
    "    - Q30\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of C because this approximation assumes that the  Analysis procedure is called only four times.\n",
    "    - Q32\n",
    "        - The correct answer is A instead of D because there does not appear to be any correlation between number of hours spent using a smartphone and number of hours spent reading.\n",
    "    - Q34\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of B because the number of mice changes each day as determined by the \"Next Day Population\" procedure.\n",
    "    - Q36\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of D because if the fraction 2/3 were to be represented as an integer, it would be rounded or truncated to an integer value.\n",
    "    - Q37\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C instead of A because the code segment II also displays the correct average.\n",
    "    - Q38\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C instead of D because the expression \"NOT(count MOD 10 = 0)\" does not evaluate to \"true\" when \"count\" is a multiple of \"10\", so this code segment doesn't set \"cose\" to \"0\" appropriately.\n",
    "    - Q40\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of C because the average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can also be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied.\n",
    "    - Q43\n",
    "        - The correct answer is A instead of C because sorting a list is not considered an undecidable problem.\n",
    "    - Q45\n",
    "        - The correct answer is C instead of A because the expression \"(NOT P) and (NOT Q)\" evaluates to \"false\" when \"P\" and \"Q\" differ in value. A \"NAND\" gate should only evaluate to \"false\" when both inputs are \"true\".\n",
    "    - Q55\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of A because the procedure always returns false.\n",
    "    - Q56\n",
    "        - The correct answer is D instead of A because the program counts odd integers, not even integers.\n",
    "    - Q57\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B instead of A because this expression returns the string \"Huppy\".\n",
    "    - Q58\n",
    "        - The correct answer is A instead of B because the Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants. However, there exist problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time, even with a distributed approach.\n",
    "    - Q60\n",
    "        - The correct answer is A and D because placing repeated code with procedure calls is an example of a procedural abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.\n",
    "    - Q63\n",
    "        - The correct answer is B and D because if count is set to 0 repeatedly inside the loop, it will not provide an accurate count of the number of prime numbers in the list."
