## Plans
- Keep improving at the Frontend skills
    - Since this is the area that I felt I'm most familar with.
        - HTML, CSS, JS
            - I'm very interested into working on Frontend because I'm really into the designs and how to make the page look visually appealing, etc...
                - Turns out that I improved a lot from when this course(APCSP) just started.
- Working on the CPT Project...
    - Trying to meet all the College Board requirements...
        - Program Code(PC)
        - Video (V)
        - Personalized Project Reference (PRR)
