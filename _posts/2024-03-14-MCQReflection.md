# Part2 - MCQ corrections/reflection
- Q6: Which of the following best exemplifies the use of multifactor authentication to protect an online banking system?
    - The correct answer should be C: After entering a password for an online bank account, a user must also enter a codw that is sent to the user’s phone via text message.
        - C because multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism.

- Q7: If a game is begun by placing the game piece on the rightmost black space for step 1, what will be the value of the counter at the end of the game?
    - The correct answer should be C: 4.
        - It's not 3 because the counter is incremented once for each time the game piece moves. The game piece makes four moves before ending in the red space.

- Q9: Which of the following best explains how an analog audio signal is typically represented by a computer?
    - The correct answer should be option B: An analog audio signal is measured at regular intervals. Each measurement is stored as a sample, which is represented at the lowest level as a sequence of bits.
        - Option B because analog signals are sampled digitally at discrete intervals over time. These samples, like all digital data, are represented at the lowest level as a sequence of bits.

- Q20: A local router is configured to limit the bandwidth of guest users connecting to the Internet. Which of the following best explains the result of this configuration as compared to a configuration in which the router does not limit the bandwidth?
    - The correct answer should be option D: Guest users will be restricted in the maximum amount of data that they can send and receive per second.
        - It's not option C because internet routing is fault-tolerant, regardless of the bandwidth of a local connection.

- Q25: Which of the following best describes the value returned by the procedure?
    - The correct answer should be option D: The procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
        - It's not option A: The procedure returns nothing because it will not terminate, because the procedure will run without error and return a value.

- Q28: In the flowchart below, assume that j and k are assigned integer values.
    - The correct answer should be option D: j = 5, k = -5
        - It's option D because the value of k is repeatedly decremented by 1 inside the loop until k = 0. If k is initially negative, it will continue to decrease without ever reaching 0.

- 35: Which of the following questions CANNOT be answered using only the information in the database?
    - THe correct answer should be option B: In the past ten years, were nonmoving violations more likely to occur on a weekend than on a weekday?
        - It's not option D: In how many of the past ten years were there more than one million moving violations?, because this information can be determined by counting the total number of moving violations that occurred each year.

- Q37: Which of the following is NOT a possible value displayed by the program?
    - The correct answer should be option C: "Carrot"
        - It's not option A: "artichoke", because the string "artichoke" is displayed for values of n that are greater than 100.

- Q46: A large spreadsheet contains the following information about local restaurants. A sample portion of the spreadsheet is shown below.
    - The correct answer should be option D: "I, II, and III".
        - It's not option A: "I and II only", because any ordering of the three steps will identify the correct restaurant. Sequence III will work. Sorting by rating will put the greatest customer rating at the top of the list. Then filtering by number of ratings will remove restaurants without any ratings. Then filtering by payment type will remove the restaurants that do not accept credit cards.

- Q49: Which of the following best explains the ability to solve problems algorithmically?
    - The correct answer should be option D: "There exist some problems that cannot be solved algorithmically using any computer."
        - It's not option A because while some solutions benefit from being validated by a human, not all problems can be solved with an algorithm.

- Q54: Using only the information in the database, which of the following questions CANNOT be answered?
    - The correct answer should be option B: "What is the average number of customer deliveries made by each truck on a particular day?".
        - It's not option C, because this information can be determined by comparing the weight of a truck when it last entered the depot to its weight when it last left the depot.

- Q57: Which of the following parallel computing solutions would minimize the amount of time it takes to execute all four processes?
    - The correct answer should be option A: "Running processes P and Q on one processor and processes R and S on the other processor".
        - It's not option D, because running process P on one processor will take a total of 30 seconds. Running processes Q, R, and S on the other processor will take a total of 45 seconds. With the processors running in parallel, this solution will take 45 seconds.

- Q59
    - The correct answer should be option C: "The current locations of other RunRoutr users".
        - It's not option D because while the usernames on Adrianna’s contact list is useful in determining whether other users are considered compatible with Adrianna, this information is determined using data provided directly by Adrianna when she creates her contact list.

- Q64
    - Another correct answer should be option B because this return statement causes execution of the procedure to end early. As a result, if age is less than 18, result will never be assigned the value "minor".

- Q65
    - Another correct answer should be option B because since NOT humid evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since hot OR humid evaluates to true, true is displayed.

- Q66
    - Another correct answer should be option D because in this code segment, if timer is greater than 60, bonus is assigned 1500 in the first IF block. If timer is between 30 and 60, inclusive, bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. 

- Q67
    - Anoter correct answer should be option D because for this spinner, there is a 1/4 chance of "blue". The remaining of the 3/4 time, "orange" and "purple" are equally likely. The variable spin is set to a random value between 1 and 4, inclusive. If spin is 1 (which occurs 1/4 of the time), the code segment prints "blue".

- Q68
    - Another correct answer should be option A because the code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. 

- Q70
    - Another correct answer should be option C because this code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to newStr. The code segment then concatenates newStr with the substring consisting of the characters to the right of position n.
