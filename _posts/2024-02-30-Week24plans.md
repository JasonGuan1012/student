    - For example, the blog covers for each.
    - Formatting the website.
    - Helping Aaron with the Food Chart (Debugging the Food Chart.)
- Trying to do the search bar.
    - Tried to connect it with the backend, however still in progress.
- Trying to qualified for the Night at the Museum, however, it ran out of spots. :(
- Finishing the Tri2 Individual Review
    - Created the Individual blog for the final review
    - Keeping on track of the daily tasks in the student blog.
- **Overall, a great trimester in AP CSP**
    - Learnt new skills, improving my frontend skills
    - Our group only has 3 people which gave us the disavantages
        - But if you think it as another way, it's a great practice for us and a good experiences for us to prepare for the future similar situations.
